    - **Performance Analysis:** The **Performance Matrix** provides a clear snapshot of my team. **Anna K.** and **Maria S.** are in the top-right "High Performer" quadrant. **David L.** is a solid performer but slightly behind on his goals. The **New Hire** is a clear outlier in the bottom-right, indicating they are meeting goals but are behind on trainingâ€”a typical and manageable situation.
    
    - **Workload & Burnout Risk:** The **Utilization Heatmap** immediately flags **Anna K.** as a critical concern. At 110% utilization, she is over-burdened, which poses a risk to both her projects and her well-being. This directly contradicts my goal of having her lead a new OpEx team.
    
    - **Strategic Action Plan:**
        1.  **Delegate:** To free up Anna's capacity, I will "delegate appropriately." The `Automate CPV Data Trending` project, currently assigned to her, is a perfect development opportunity for **Maria S.**, whose goal is to gain expertise in new areas. I will re-assign this project.
        2.  **Onboarding Focus:** I will work with David L. (the designated mentor) and the New Hire to create a 30-day plan to close the 25% training gap, moving them into the "High Performer" quadrant.
        3.  **Performance Coaching:** In my upcoming 1-on-1 with David L., we will focus on the 15% gap in his quarterly goals to understand the blockers and create a plan to ensure he hits 100% next quarter.
