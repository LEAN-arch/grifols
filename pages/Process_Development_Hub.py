    #### The Goal
    To efficiently map the relationship between two critical formulation parameters (**Temperature** and **pH**) and a key quality attribute (**Stability**). The goal is to identify an operating window where the reagent is robust and maintains its potency over time, even with minor variations in the manufacturing environment. This is a foundational step to **"drive and validate process improvements."**

    #### The Method: Response Surface Methodology (RSM)
    A quadratic statistical model is built from the DOE data to create a "map" of the process. This model allows us to visualize the response (Stability) across the entire design space and identify the optimal operating region. This scientific approach is critical to **"ensure appropriate acceptance criteria are applied and justified"** for our processes.

    - **Process Understanding:** The 3D surface plot provides an intuitive "map" of our process, making it an excellent tool for communicating with our cross-functional partners in Manufacturing and QA. It clearly shows the "peak" of stability.
    
    - **Control Strategy Definition:** The 2D contour plot is where we make our key decisions. The analysis shows that our process is far more sensitive to changes in **pH** than it is to **Temperature**. The green "sweet spot" (Proven Acceptable Range) is very narrow along the pH axis. This is a critical insight.
    
    - **Data-Driven Decision:** Based on this data, I will direct the team to implement a tight control limit for pH (e.g., 7.40 Â± 0.05) in the Master Batch Record. The acceptable range for temperature can be wider (e.g., 20-30Â°C), which provides operational flexibility to the manufacturing team without compromising product quality.
    
    - **Audit Defense:** In a regulatory inspection, I can use this interactive plot to **"describe and defend"** our control strategy. I can show the auditor our design space and use the slider to demonstrate how our chosen operating ranges ensure we consistently meet our stability specification of **{stability_spec:.1f}%**. This provides clear, objective evidence of a well-characterized and robust process.
