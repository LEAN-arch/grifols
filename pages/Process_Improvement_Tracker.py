    A core part of my responsibility as Senior Manager is to **"drive and validate process improvements in manufacturing"** and to demonstrate expertise with methodologies like **"Lean, 5S, [and] Operational Excellence."** This dashboard is the central management tool for this program.

    - **Strategic Direction:** I use this platform to translate high-level goals (e.g., "increase efficiency") into a portfolio of specific, actionable projects for my team. The "Business Driver" for each initiative ensures alignment with Grifols' objectives.
    - **Resource Management:** By assigning leads and tracking status, I can manage my team's bandwidth and ensure these important, non-routine projects receive the appropriate focus without jeopardizing our core validation and transfer work.
    - **Fostering Innovation:** This dashboard makes process improvement a formal and visible part of our team's responsibilities. It empowers my staff to be "creative... and innovative" by providing a structured way to propose, execute, and get recognition for projects that challenge the status quo.
    - **Demonstrating Value:** This provides a clear overview of our improvement efforts, which I can present to leadership to showcase my department's proactive contributions to the business beyond just maintaining compliance.

    This dashboard provides me with the necessary tools to effectively lead our continuous improvement program.

    1.  **Project Oversight & Prioritization:** I can quickly see that our two "In Progress" initiatives are critical to our department's efficiency. The **Standardized Tech Transfer Template** will reduce errors and speed up future projects, while the **Reduce Re-work in Doc Review** project directly addresses a known bottleneck. I will follow up with the leads, Anna and David, to ensure they have the support they need.

    2.  **Strategic Planning:** The `Automate CPV Data Trending` project is currently "Not Started." This is a high-value project that will save significant engineering time. After reviewing the team's workload on the main **Command Center**, I will schedule a kick-off for this project for the next quarter.

    3.  **Performance Management:** I use this dashboard in my 1-on-1s. For example, I can praise Maria S. for successfully completing the 5S project. I can also work with Anna K., whose development goal is leadership, to ensure she is effectively managing the cross-functional aspects of the template standardization project. This helps me "manage and develop staff" in a practical, hands-on way.
