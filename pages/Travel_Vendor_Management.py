    While data provides a powerful overview, effective management of external partners and critical projects often requires on-site presence. My role states I **"may require travel up to 10% to vendors or other Grifols sites."** This dashboard is my tool for managing this responsibility strategically.

    - **Purposeful Travel:** I use this to plan and justify all travel, ensuring it is targeted and provides value. This includes "person-in-plant" oversight during critical validation batches, supplier audits, and strategic partnership meetings.
    - **Vendor Management:** A significant portion of our work relies on external vendors for services, testing, and materials. This hub provides a centralized place to track our key partners, their status, and performance notes.
    - **Budgetary Control:** All travel and external services have budgetary implications. This tool helps me to plan for these expenses and track them against the departmental budget managed in the **Budget Tracker**.
    - **Cross-Functional Visibility:** It provides visibility to my leadership and cross-functional partners on my engagement with external sites, reinforcing our commitment to strong partnerships.

    This dashboard allows me to manage the external-facing aspects of my role with structure and foresight.

    1.  **Planning & Justification:** The travel plan is not just a schedule; it's a justification tool. For the upcoming trip to Germany, I can clearly articulate to my leadership that the purpose is a strategic audit of a key supplier, which is critical for de-risking our supply chain.

    2.  **Resource Allocation:** I can see that David L. recently completed a "person-in-plant" trip. In his next 1-on-1, I will debrief with him to gather insights that can only be obtained by being on the manufacturing floor. This ensures we get maximum value from the travel budget.

    3.  **Risk Management:** The vendor list immediately flags that **GMP Consumables Co.** is a high-risk, sole supplier. This data point is a direct input to our program's risk register and justifies initiating a project to qualify a second supplier, which I can then add to my team's portfolio in the main **Command Center**.

    4.  **Budgeting:** The planned trips and active vendor services are tangible items with real costs. I use this information to build an accurate forecast for the 'Travel' and 'External Testing/Consulting' categories in my **Budget Tracker**, ensuring there are no financial surprises.
